Hello I'm Arifin, a 2nd year Master's Degree student in Astrophysics at Bandung Institute of Technology ([ITB](https://www.as.itb.ac.id/)), fully funded by the Indonesian government through [LPDP](https://www.lpdp.kemenkeu.go.id/) Scholarship. My research interest are instrumentation, heliophysics and image processing.

Currently I am also a Research Fellow in [Imahnoong](https://imahnoong.com/) Planetarium and Observatory. We are developing IoT instruments for astronomy-related monitoring and an astronomical observation how-to guide.

My Undergraduate final project is about particle track simulation for CERN ALICE [Time Projection Chamber](https://alice-tpc.web.cern.ch/content/alice-time-projection-chamber), under the guidance of Dr. Rifki Sadikin from Indonesian Institute of Sciences ([LIPI](http://lipi.go.id/)) and Dr. Aloysius Rusli from Department of Phyics, Parahyangan Catholic University ([UNPAR](https://fisika.unpar.ac.id/)).

Other than astro-stuff, I like farming, hiking and learning how to be a good writer. Pardon my occasional corny jokes.

## Research Projects

Some of my actively on-going projects, please contact me if more information is needed.

#### Twilight Remote Observatory (TwRO)

Instruments consisting of a camera, Sky Quality Meter (SQM) and environmental sensors, to take long term monitoring data from the twilight phase. We are going to observe in depth about the romantic & dramatic time of the day. Open for collaboration, the whole system will consist of Field Intruments, Cloud Database, Image Processing methodology (pipeline if needed) and Knowledge-base Website.

#### Deep Lensing

One of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity consequences is Gravitational Lensing, because light follows the bending of space time by massive objects. Galaxy-Quasar Lensing is an example where a Galaxy acting as a lens for futher Quasar, so we can observe the light from Quasar, even if it is behind the Galaxy. In this research group, we are going to build a Deep Learning algorithm to find Lensing candidates in Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera (HSC) recent survey [data release](https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/). Interesting how the natural telescope exist in our Universe.

#### EcoSol SunHarvester

Passion project I started since I was in elementary school (2007) about Solar Thermal Collector (STC) to heat water. This project introduces me to the world of research and development, embark me on a wonderful adventure. The development is still on-going, I am planning to make the technology open-source, to help reducing the carbon footprint of our daily life enjoyment, hot water shower and dishwashing.

## Outreach

I am passionate about public outreach for Astronomy and science in general. I want to make STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) accessible and useful to everyone. You will find a some lists of recomended open science resources, tutorials and popular science articles. Any suggestions, requests and contribution are highly appreciated!

#### Camilan Ilmu

Short how-to video about science and techology in general. 

#### Public Talks
